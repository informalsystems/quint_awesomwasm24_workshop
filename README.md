This repo contains materials for the "CosmWasm Contract Security: Practical Formal Methods with Quint" workshop held at AwesomWasm 2024.

## Pre-Workshop
Let's install the software useful for coding along in the workshop.

### 1. Install Quint
Run `npm i @informalsystems/quint -g`

Check that Quint is installed by running `quint --version`. (The version at the time of AwesomWasm is `0.20.0`.)

### 2. Install the VSCode plugin

This plugin provides language support for Quint inside VSCode: syntax highlighting, typechecking, and similar.

In the VSCode go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+x or Cmd+Shift+x) and search for "Quint". You will find the `Quint` extension by Informal Sytems.

For other editors, see instructions [here](https://github.com/informalsystems/quint?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

### 3. Install the ITF Trace Viewer plugin

This plugin helps visualizing Quint-produced traces.

Go to Extensions and search for "ITF Trace Viewer". There will be an extension of that name by Informal Systems.

Happy modeling with Quint :)

### For the impatient
If you want to try out Quint before the workshop, have a look at [Quint tutorials](https://github.com/informalsystems/quint/tree/main/tutorials).
